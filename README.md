# Run Link Prioritization order & link queue analysis experiments
Simple typescript files that run various configurations of Comunica with link prioritization.
NOTE: This is a WIP repository, when I'm back from my holidays I will work on making a repository that is easily used for reproducing the results, has all code in one place, and is suitable for the paper.
